# Set Limit of ENV Variables
#
# The LimitRequestFieldSize directive allows the server administrator to 
# reduce or increase the limit on the allowed size of an HTTP request header 
# field. A server needs this value to be large enough to hold any one header 
# field from a normal client request

LimitRequestFieldSize 4096

# The LimitRequestFields directive allows the server administrator to 
# modify the limit on the number of request header fields allowed in an HTTP
# request. A server needs this value to be larger than the number of fields
# that a normal client request might include. The number of request header
# fields used by a client rarely exceeds 20, but this may vary among different
# client implementations, often depending upon the extent to which a user has
# configured their browser to support detailed content negotiation

LimitRequestFields 32

# The LimitRequestBody directive allows the user to set a limit on
# the allowed size of an HTTP request message body within the context in which
# the directive is given (server, per-directory, per-file or per-location). If
# the client request exceeds that limit, the server will return an error
# response instead of servicing the request. The size of a normal request
# message body will vary greatly depending on the nature of the resource and
# the methods allowed on that resource

LimitRequestBody 0

# The LimitRequestLine directive allows the server administrator to 
# reduce the limit on the allowed size of a client's HTTP request-line 
# below the normal input buffer size compiled with the
# server. Since the request-line consists of the HTTP method, URI, and protocol
# version, the LimitRequestLine directive places a restriction on the length of
# a request-URI allowed for a request on the server. A server needs this value
# to be large enough to hold any of its resource names, including any
# information that might be passed in the query part of a GET request
